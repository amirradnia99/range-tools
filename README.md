# Range Utilities

This Python script provides two utility functions for working with number ranges:
1. **`expand_ranges`**: Converts a list of range strings into a list of individual numbers.
2. **`collapse_ranges`**: Converts a list of individual numbers into a list of range strings.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download the `range_utils.py` file and import it into your Python project.

## Usage

### Importing the Functions
To use the functions, import them from the `range_utils.py` file:
